# mood-tracker
 
A simple CLI using Python to access the corresponding api.

Mood tracker is a project to keep track of mood. Create entries by entering a value from 1 to 10 representing your mood, keep similar 1-10 records for custom values, and tag entries with activities from that day. The idea is to use this data and see which activities influence mood (or other values), and just in general, to see how mood fluxuates over time.

A work in progress; I plan to add onto it when I come across new technologies relevant to this project.

## Current features
- login
- create a new entry
- view basic stats: last instance of a given activity, see graph of mood over time
